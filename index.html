        <h2>PROJECT WORK</h2>
        <h3>
          Speech Enhancement Using Adaptive Filter Algorithms - A Comparison
          Study
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Dec 2023 - Apr 2024</strong></p>
        <p>
          Used technologies: MATLAB, App designer tool. The project investigates
          the efficacy of three adaptive filters – Kalman, NLMS-LPC, and Wiener
          – for enhancing speech quality amidst random noise. By employing
          MATLAB, the study evaluates their performance using metrics such as
          SNR, PSNR, MSE, and MAE. Spectral analysis further elucidates the
          filters' ability to suppress noise across different frequency ranges.
          Results indicate the Kalman filter's superiority in maintaining speech
          clarity and intelligibility, underscoring its potential in real-world
          speech enhancement applications.
